There used to be a mountain, a temple in the mountain, and an old monk in the
temple. The old monk was telling a story to the young monk.

The old monk felt that it would be a good lesson in life to tell the young monk the stories of his youth. He meant 
to pass on the important knowledge and secrets that the monks were tasked with protecting. The most important of which
was the legend of the sword Soul Drinker, a cursed blade that would corrupt the soul of whoever uses it. The monks were
some of the few people that knew of the swords existance, they also knew that it was a source of terrible evil.
